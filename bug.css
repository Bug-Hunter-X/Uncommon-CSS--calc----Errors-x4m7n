The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected layout or styling issues.  For example, attempting to use `calc()` with percentages and pixels without proper unit handling may lead to incorrect results. Another common issue is nesting `calc()` functions incorrectly, which can cause parsing errors.  A less common but crucial issue involves using `calc()` within properties that don't accept calculations, which can silently fail without any error messages.
